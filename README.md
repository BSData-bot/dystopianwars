##Overview##

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles. Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]


__Still to Finish__

Since BS 2.0 has been released I started rewriting the entire lot, after getting 2 fleets finished on my end Spartan announced the 2.5 release of the Rules with their kickstarter. And working varying shifts each week I would rather wait till the 2.5 book releases and update the entire game to it's latest version then rather than upgrading to work perfectly with BS2.0 then rewriting the whole thing again with the new Game Rules releasing in less than a month

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]
