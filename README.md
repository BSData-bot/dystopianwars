##Overview##

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles. Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]


__Still to Finish__

So Dystopian Wars 2.5 has hit the wild and I am working of this when I'm not at work or out of town. Currently there is only the Kingdom of Britannia and the Empire of the Blazing Sun complete.

You will need to delete your old data to download this new one.

If you were still using Dystopian Wars 2.0 on BattleScribe 1.15.x keep doing that in the meantime but do not update data until the entire set is released for 2.5 on BattleScribe 2.x

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]
